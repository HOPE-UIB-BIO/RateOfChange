CharSNI = function(CharData,BandWidth) {
  ## Calculate signal-to-noise index (SNI) for a charcoal record.
  #
  # CharData = Matrix of input data with one row per sample, containing:
  #   Column 1: age associated with the sample (yr)
  #   Column 2: charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR) of the sample (pieces/cm^2/yr)
  #   Column 3: threshold value (pieces/cm^2/yr)
  #
  # BandWidth = Width of moving window for computing SNI 
  #
  #
  # This function computes SNI as described in Kelly et al. 2010.  Note that
  # your data must be interpolated to constant sample resolution (yr/sample)
  # before input to the function. The function makes no assumption about
  # prior analysis on the input CHAR series, i.e. any background and
  # threshold methods may be used.  However, input data should still be
  # consistent with the interpretation that a CHAR value (column 2) greater
  # than the corresponding threshold value (column 3) is a "signal" sample,
  # whereas a CHAR value below the threshold is "noise".  Refer to Kelly et
  # al. 2010 for details and discussion.
  #
  # SNI_output is a data list containing the computed SNI and related
  # data, with one row for each row in the input variable CharData:
  #   
  #   $SNI    = the SNI computed for each sample
  #   $winInd = indexes of the first and last samples included in each moving 
  #     window.  E.g. SNI_output$winInd(X) == [A, B] indicates that the 
  #     moving window used to calculate SNI for the Xth sample contained all 
  #     samples between A and B, inclusive.
  #   $popN   = the CHAR values of all samples in the noise (N) population 
  #     (samples in the moving window with CHAR below threshold)
  #   $popS   = the CHAR values of all samples in the signal (S) population 
  #     (samples in the moving window with CHAR at or above threshold)
  #   $meanN  = mean CHAR of the samples in popN
  #   $stdN   = standard deviation of the samples in popN
  #   $CF     = the "correction factor" used in computing SNI.  Equal to
  #     (v - 2)/v ,where v is the number of samples in popN
